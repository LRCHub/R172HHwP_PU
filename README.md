(Dialing, phone ringing)
Operator
Oh ya
I'll never stop
Ooh no
Do you believe me,
After all that's said and done
All the lies, how I regret them
baby now
I am the loser
When you shining like the sun
Tell me why can't I still be
the one?
All right
I will never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end
of time
Coz my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop
I'll never stop
How could I ever
When my heart is in your hands
And I know baby there is not
turning back
They say that I'm crazy
And I kind of understand
How I wish for this nightmare
to end
Oh yes
I will never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end
of time
Coz my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop
I'll never stop
Yeah ay
I'll never stop
Oh oh oh,
Do you believe me
When my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop {I will never
stop}
Till the end of time {I will
wait forever}
My heart is in your hands {My
heart is in your hands}
I will never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end
of time
Coz my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop
I'll never stop
