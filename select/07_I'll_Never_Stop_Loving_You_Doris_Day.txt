I'll never stop loving you
Whatever else I may do
My love for you
Will live 'till time itself is through

I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat
The way it does each time we meet

The night doesn't question the stars
That appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars
That appear in my eyes

Of this, I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never
No, I'll never stop loving you
Of this, I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never
No, I'll never stop loving you
