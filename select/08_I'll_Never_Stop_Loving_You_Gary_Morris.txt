I just might take to leavin'
In the middle of the night
And I might not be here in the morning light
But I'll never stop loving you
Loving you

I might move into Memphis on a fast moving train
Thumbin' down some trucker heading West in the fast lane
But I'll never stop loving you
Loving you

Just as sure as that Mississippi
Flows to the sea
I'll run just as wild
Love just as deep
I'll never stop loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you

I might call from Atlanta
For bus fare home
Call you from Dallas
To tell you what flight I'm on
But I'll never stop loving you
Loving you

Just as sure as the suns sets
On that beach in Malibu
I might go round the world
But I'll come back to you
But I'll never stop loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you

I told you when I met you
I would never let you put chains on me
And you never tried in my life
You know that means
Everything

Just as sure as Manhattan
Is sittin' on a bed of stone
You know that I won't leave you
In your bed alone too long
I'll never stop loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you

I'll never stop loving you
Loving you
